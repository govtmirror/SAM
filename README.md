SAM-Helper
==========

The Chrome Extensions for SAM Helper and the helper configuration editor


This repository contains three directories:

samHelper contains the actual Chrome extension for user install

helper-gen contains an extension that parses and updates the helper content

processHelperFiles contains a super-trivial web server that serves up the JSON config file used by both extensions.  It can  be run as a node file.
